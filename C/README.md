# C Colors
Okay, C deals with colors really badly (in my humble opinion.) It's an old language, so this can sort of be forgiven, but I haven't found a better way to format colors than with this library.

## Executables

|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| rainbows.c        | make run_rainbows | Function that prints the colors each character a different color (not actually rainbow order).    |
