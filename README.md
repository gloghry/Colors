# Terminal color libraries and hints
Making colors appear on the terminal can be chore in some languages. This repo aims to be a space where I can view notes, examples, and libraries I've amassed for certain languages. **Each lower directory has a README which specifies how the test can be ran!**

## Supported Languages
- Bash
- C

## Warning
As with all terminal color libraries, this can change depending on both your hardware and software setup. Colors, traditionally, haven't always cross compatable between the vast amount of different options for monitors and terminals and implementations can be complex to deal with that. Nowadays it's more standardized and more user friendly than say C, for example.
